## Introduction
This is my first attempt/MVP creating an AI content generation system that turns a simple user prompt into a short form video that can be uploaded to social media platforms or to friends just for fun.
The first iteration of the MVP should run 100% locally using your own device to generate whatever you desire.

## Requirements
- Python 3
  - [Download Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Ollama
- Tacotron 2 + WaveGlow
- Open CV
- FFmpeg

## MVP Plan
- Generate Script using Ollama
- Generate Audio Recording using Tacotron/WaveGlow
- Generate Background Gameplay/B roll using Open CV
- Render the audio over the background gameplay using FFmpeg
- Save file locally

## Future of the Project
- Possibly turn it into a monetized webapp?
- FastAPI/React/Supabase?
- Could be something cool, stay tuned :)
